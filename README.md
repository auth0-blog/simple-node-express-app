# Create a Simple, Stylish, and Secure Node Express App

In this tutorial series, you'll learn how to create a secure and simple **Node.js** application built with the **Express** web framework. You'll see how **Passport.js with Auth0** is used to manage user authentication and protect routes. On the frontend, you'll use **Pug** templates for rendering views along with **CSS** for maintaining style sheets.

## Auth0: Never Compromise on Identity

At [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), we make heavy use of full-stack JavaScript to help our customers to [manage user identities including password resets, creating and provisioning, blocking and deleting users](https://auth0.com/user-management). We also created a serverless platform, called [Auth0 Extend](https://auth0.com/extend/), that enables customers to run arbitrary JavaScript functions securely. Therefore, it must come as no surprise that using our identity management platform on JavaScript web apps is a piece of cake.

[Auth0 offers a **free tier**](https://auth0.com/pricing) to get started with modern authentication. Check it out, or <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">sign up for a free Auth0 account here</a>!
